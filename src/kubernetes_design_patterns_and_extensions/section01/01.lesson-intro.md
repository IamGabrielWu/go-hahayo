### kubernetes design patterns
recreate strategies (downtime)
1. kubectl get deployment recreate -w
2. kubectl patch deployment recreate -p 'xxxx'

rolling update strategies (no downtime but different versions serving together)
blue/green strategy (blue is serving but green is being tested for update when test is done, loadbalancer is switched to green)
A/B Testing strategy (no downtime but different versions serving together and users are directed by A/B routing)

strategy
recreate: downtime, no real traffic testing, no targeted users
rolling update: no downtime, no real traffic testing, no targeted user, no double infra cost
blue/green: no downtime, no real traffic testing, no targeted user, double infra cost
A/B testing: no downtime, real traffic testing, targeted user, double infra cost
